TODO:
=====

 - Sometimes the carousel/slider on the header part is too narrow. Investigate and fix!
 - Display team info based on data from config/data file instead of hard-coded html
 - Fix info/text about members
 - Test pagination
 - Commenting? (Not really necessary now)
 - Author's name should be clickable and it should redirect to the page about the author
 - Author's picture, name and info should be displayed at the top of a blog post
 - After author's name is clickable and member info is rendered from config/data file, there should be a template page similar to the popup page.
